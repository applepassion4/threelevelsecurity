### Three Level Security (User authentication)

**Project Description:**

![23qtg3hvggm0gux8nu0v](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53684246/142770280-fb007224-6cb3-4516-9c12-337b2c086cd6.jpeg)


Most of nowadays applications prioritize availability over security. A simple user name, a password, and data can be accessed, no matter how sensible they are. Techniques like cryptography and hashing have been used to try and keep those passwords secure from any adversary, but attacks like online and offline dictionary attacks have seen those security measures broken. And if broken then your everything can be accessed. For a system that requires a lot of security, there is a need for more security when we talk about authentication. In this project three-layer authentication security system will be designed.


**Questions:**

* Is there a correlation between ethanol consumption and various mortality rates?
* Correlation between average alcohol consumption and mortality rate?
* Correlation over the corresponding years of data?



**Data Sources:**

Consumption of alcohol per capita in each of 50 states + DC from 1970 - 2019 [[National Institute of Health]](https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/surveillance117/pcyr1970-2019.txt)

Mortality rates by state and county for 21 categories in 8 different years from 1980 - 2014 [[Journal of American Medical Association (via Kaggle)]](https://www.kaggle.com/IHME/us-countylevel-mortality)



#### **Data Cleaning:**

Screenshot of Mortality Data File

**Mortality Categories:**

* HIV/AIDS & Tuberculosis
* Maternal Disorders
* Neonatal Disorders
* Nutritional Deficiencies
* Cardiovascular Diseases
* Cirrhosis & Other Chronic
* Neurological Disorders
* Mental Substance Abuse
* Diabetes Urogenital Blood
* Transport Injuries
* Unintentional Injuries
* Self Harm / Interpersonal

**Ethanol Consumption (Beverage Types):**

* Spirits

* Wines

* Beer

* All Beverages

**Years:** 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2014

**Population:** Gallons of Ethanol Consumption per capita Age 21 and Older

**Analysis:**

**ANOVA Test of Ethanol Consumption by Year**
![ANOVA](Images/screenshot_ANOVA.png)

The change in ethanol consumption is significant from year to year.

Correlation of alcohol consumption and mortality types

* Strongest positive correlation = Cirrhosis

* Strongest negative correlation = Diabetes and Cardiovascular

Heatmap Example for Mortality Type Mental/Substance Use
![heatmap](Images/heatmap.png)
*  This shows an increase in mental and substance abuse mortality over time

*  The mortality rate is higher in states such as Alaska and New Mexico and West Virginia than compared to the rest of the country

**Conclusions:**

* General correlation over all years is weaker than individual years
* Moderate positive correlation for several mortality categories
* Correlations between ethanol consumption and mortality rates associated with cirrhosis and mental/substance use moderate over multiple years
* Ethanol consumption in the US has changed over the years analyzed - curious drop in consumption from 1980 to 1995
* Negative correlations between ethanol consumption and mortality rates associated with cardio and diabetes
